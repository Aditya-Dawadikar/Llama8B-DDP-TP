This directory stores logs, metrics and profiling traces generated by the
training and benchmarking scripts.  The scripts will create subdirectories
under `runs/` for each experiment and save evaluation metrics in JSON format
alongside the adapter checkpoints.  Profiling outputs such as `trace.json`
are also written here.
